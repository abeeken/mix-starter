# mix-starter
A little starter project for Node.js with asset compilation handled by Laravel Mix

Clone down and run _npm install_ to get started

Customise the mix function in __webpack.mix.js__

Add functionality to __app.js__

Run _npm run build_ to build assets, or _npm run watch_ to watch for scss and js changes

Run _npm run server_ to start the Express server, or _npm run server--dev_ to start the server using Nodemon - this will restart if you change the app.js file

Pug is used for views - you can find these in __src/views/__

Happy coding!
